# Takuhai 宅配便 CLI Chat
Takuhai is a CLI Chat application that was developed as the final project for the lecture `Cryptographic Engineering` in the computer science masters program of the University of Kassel.

The main goal of the lecture was to learn implementing various different cryptographic algorithms that were or are used in applications around the world. 

This implementation provides a [Client]() and [Server]() pair that can be started individually via terminals. Clients can then register to the server and send messages to other registered clients.
